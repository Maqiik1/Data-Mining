This project works with data set of web pages from computer science departments
of various universities. The 3710 pages correspond to the personal web
pages of either students (1642), faculty members (1125) or courses (931) within
these departments.

Step 1: Run all codes

Step 2: You will see that all codes were run properly, including, features, models and evaluation.

The software is possible to read the training data from a directory with three
subdirectories (one for each class), and read the test data from a single
directory.

The path to these directories is seen inside the command line but can but also simply 
run by being incorporated in different directory.

The README file is used also for a trainig purposes of researcher to test README in GitHub.
